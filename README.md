A lil' cheating thing for gleam.io to type fake alts quicker.

## Usage
Key | Function
--- | ---
`H` | Input a name and a fake generated e-mail for gleam.io
`T` | Inputs a name and fake generated e-mail and password for twitter, then closes the window after 1 second.
`Y` | Same as H, but also adds a date if the giveaway asks for that.
`G` | Creates a new tab and goes to the twitter sign up site, faster than waiting for the confirmation button to appear.

### P.S.
I am aware that gleam.io will eventually put you in a cooldown after repeated use, and twitter will require a phone number for new accounts. To combat this, use a VPN. If you run out of VPN's, wait for the cooldowns to end. (if they do 🤔)
